This code is designed to reproduce the results from the paper "Non-standard power grid frequency statistics in Europe, Australia, and Asia" and can be used to test bimodality, linearity, and Markovian behavior for your own data.

The Asian countries analysis and European countries file include a range of code functionalities. These functionalities encompass time series plotting, frequency distribution, and its increments, stationary testing, dip statistics, autocorrelation plotting, as well as the necessary functions for conducting linear tests and detrended fluctuation analysis. Dip statistics and linear test results are saved for future visualization purposes. Kindly access the data utilized through this link: https://power-grid-frequency.org/

We utilize three synthetic datasets of Ireland generated by stochastic differential models to validate our linear test findings in the Linear test Ireland file. For further details on these three stochastic differential models, please refer to the work by Oberhofer, Ulrich, et al. titled "Non-linear, bivariate stochastic modelling of power-grid frequency applied to islands," available in the arXiv preprint arXiv:2301.04551 (2023). https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04551. Kindly access the data utilized through this link: https://github.com/KIT-IAI-DRACOS/Stochastic-modelling-of-power-grid-frequency-applied-to-islands

The visualizing file is utilized to display the location of the analyzed regions as well as the outcomes of the dip statistics and linear tests.

Should you wish to analyze additional datasets, you can seamlessly upload your data and re-execute the entire codebase.
